Question 1
----------
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. 
The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

/* QUERY 1 - query used to get count of rentals by film in each family friendly category*/
WITH T1 
AS (SELECT f.title title, c.name category
	FROM category c
    JOIN film_category fc
    	ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
    JOIN film f
    	ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
    JOIN inventory i
    	ON f.film_id = i.film_id
    JOIN rental r
    	ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
	WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music'))

SELECT title, category, COUNT(*) total_rented
FROM t1
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2, 3 DESC;                      


Question 2
----------
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for.
Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) 
based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the average rental duration(in the number of days) for movies across all categories?

/*Query 2 - query used to get the average length of rental duration for these family-friendly movies
WITH T2
AS (SELECT *, 
	NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY t1.rental_duration) as standard_quartile
	FROM (SELECT f.title, c.name, f.rental_duration
			FROM category c
			JOIN film_category fc
				ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
			JOIN film f
				ON fc.film_id = f.film_id) T1)

SELECT title, name, rental_duration, standard_quartile,
CASE
	WHEN standard_quartile = '1' THEN 'first quarter'
    WHEN standard_quartile = '2' THEN 'second quarter'
    WHEN standard_quartile = '3' THEN 'third quarter'
    ELSE 'final quarter'
END AS level,
CASE 
	WHEN name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music') THEN 'true'
    ELSE 'false'
END AS family_friendly
FROM t2
ORDER BY 4, 2, 1;


Quetion 3
---------
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within 
each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category.

/*Query 3 - query used to get count of movies within each family friendly category*/
WITH T1
AS (SELECT c.name, f.rental_duration, NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY f.rental_duration) standard_quartile
	FROM category c 
	JOIN film_category fc
    	ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
	JOIN film f
	    ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
	WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music'))
    
SELECT name, standard_quartile, COUNT(standard_quartile)
FROM T1
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;


Question 4
----------
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. 
Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for 
that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

SELECT DATE_PART('month', r.rental_date) Rental_month,
		DATE_PART('year', r.rental_date) Rental_year,
        s.store_id Store_ID,
    	COUNT(*) Count_rentals
FROM rental r
JOIN staff s 
	ON r.staff_id = s.staff_id
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 2, 1, 3;
